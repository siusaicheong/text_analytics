Commentary

     A Government spokesman noted that external trade sustained robust performance so far in 2018, thanks to sturdy global demand. Merchandise exports continued to grow strongly over a year earlier in May, with many major markets showing double-digit gains.

     The spokesman commented further that, looking ahead, the current momentum of the global economy should remain supportive to Hong Kong's exports in the near term. Yet, external uncertainties have increased markedly of late, as a result of the escalation of trade conflicts between the US and the Mainland. This might weigh on the prevailing global economic sentiment and trade expansion going forward. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.
