Commentary
 
     The value of merchandise exports grew further over a year earlier in June, albeit at a decelerated pace against a high base of comparison. Exports to many major markets registered growth of varying degree.
 
     Looking ahead, while growth momentum of the global economy has been sustained so far this year, rising trade conflicts between the US and other major economies could weigh on global economic sentiment and trade expansion going forward, posing downside risks to Hong Kong's export outlook. The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely.
